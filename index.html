            <p>After spending Fifteen years growing up in refuge in the Wildlands during the purging of Mages in Targoviste, by the order of <i>Bishop Axel of the Catholic Church.</i> Riley of Fire and Blood, now a level 20 Mage is back seeking revenge and her lost brothers. Instead, she meets a ravaged city destroyed by Mehmed II.  Mehmed II and his henchmen have waged war on the people of Targoviste and Vlad Tepes (Dracula),
                the natives left alive attempt to flee to neighbouring cities. Riley discovers an undergound network of new genaration mages who intend to go to war with Mehmed II and his hoard and therefore seek her help, she finds the new genaration of Mages are helping Dracula and the Catholic church fight off the nightly raid of Targoviste which greatly displeases her.
                <strong>She later finds a now repentant Axel and attempts to kill him but fails to, this act angers the mages and forces them to reject Riley as one of them</strong>, eventually pushing her away to join Mehmed II and his hoard.</p>
